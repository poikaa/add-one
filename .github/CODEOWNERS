# Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone
# opens a pull request that modifies code that they own.
# Order is important, the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.

# Default owners for everything in the repo
@ikim23

# When someone opens a pull request that only modifies JS files,
# only @js-owner and not the global owner(s) will be requested for a review.
# *.js @js-owner

# @docs-owner owns any file in the `/docs` directory in the root of your repository.
# /docs/ @docs-owner
